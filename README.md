# nerminsehic.me Blog

The source code for my personal blog. You can check out the blog [here](https://nerminsehic.me).

## Motivation
In my career as a software developer, I am constantly learning new concepts and strategies. I wanted to have a site where I could host small articles about the things I learn that I could refer back to in the future or share with my colleagues.

Creating this site also allows me to tell others who I am and allows me to share important links. I attend a few meetups and conferences in Melbourne and I want to share my site with others to that they can see what I am working on.

## Technologies
I have decided to build this site using Next.js and Typescript. On top of that I am using [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) for styling (CSS-in-JS) and [Prismic](https://prismic.io/) as my CMS of choice.

I have used this tech stack in the past and I personally think the developer experience is unmatched. If you're wondering why I like Prismic, check out this article on [Slice Machine](https://prismic.io/blog/slice-machine-empowers-developers).

## Contributing
If you stumble across my site and notice a bug or problem, you're more than welcome to create an issue here. I don't have any hard requirements for issues, just let me know how I can replicate the bug.
